# Just Encrypt Lah

You can see the website [here](https://justencrypt.github.io/).

This is an experimental static website that wraps some basic public key cryptography features, to allow users to securely share secrets. It has zero external dependencies, and only needs a browser which supports the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API#Browser_compatibility).

There are easier ways to securely share secrets if both the sender and receiver has access to end-to-end encrypted apps such as [Signal app](https://signal.org).
